# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This project initially started as a console-based game and has now been modified to include a user interface (UI). You can now enjoy playing Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer using buttons instead of console inputs.

## Game Instructions

Follow these instructions to play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game:

1. In each round, you need to make a selection by clicking on one of the three buttons: "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".

2. The computer will make its selection randomly, and the winner of the round will be determined based on the classic rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

3. The game will display the results of each round on the webpage, announcing the winner or declaring a tie.

4. The running score will be displayed, keeping track of the points for both the player and the computer.

5. The game continues until one player reaches 5 points. At that point, the game declares the overall winner.

### Score Tracking

The game keeps track of the score, displaying the running total of points for both the player and the computer. The score is updated after each round, allowing you to monitor your progress throughout the game.

### Winner Announcement

Once a player reaches 5 points, the game declares the overall winner. It displays a congratulatory message for the winner and concludes the game.
